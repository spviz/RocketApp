# Development
The app is built on the MVP architecture. 
The app's user interface was programmatically built using the UIKit framework.
Different approaches were used for each screen, including TableView, CollectionView, and CollectionView with CompositionalLayout. 
User data is saved using UserDefaults, API calls are made using URLSession.
Unit tests were also written for the app.
